For Server Owners:
You do not need any of these files. 
The only file that might be of interest to you is Items.yml, but this is downloaded on first-run. If this fails, feel free to download this one and place it in your CustomItems folder.

For Plugin Developers:
You only need the CustomItems.java
Add it to your source and change the package declaration. You must initialise it once with:
new CustomItems(Plugin);

All other methods are static, so you shouldn't need to keep the CustomItems object (it stores itself).
